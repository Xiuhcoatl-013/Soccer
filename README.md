# Automating Data Collection And Match Analysis From Video Footage

<p> Researching and analysing player movement using detailed positional football data. This work has focused on the investigation of real-time skeleton
 extraction to perform match analysis of player movement with the aim of fostering the understanding of comparative and competitive behaviours in soccer football.
 This proposal has revolutionised the way match and tactical analysis is performed by teaching computers how to measure key playing aspects of the sport,
 such as team dominance or a playerâ€™s control of space derived directly from video footage. By developung an automatic and dynamic model that takes into account
 the contextual factors that influence the movement and behaviour of players during a match. This novel player detection system automatically is able to display
 complex and advanced 5-D visualisations that are superimposed on original video footage.</p>
